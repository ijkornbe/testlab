<p> Having been born and raised in Columbus, OH in the year 2002, I am not the Buckeyes fan that most would expect.
<br> My entire family is from London, England, so I was never really immersed into the American football culture.
<br> Now being at Syracuse University, I am a Graphic Design major in the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications.
<br> I am also an Information Technology, Design and Startups minor in the iSchool.
<br> Outside of school, I enjoy reseraching the fashion industry, learning about technology, being with my friends, and most importantly, being with my family.</p>
